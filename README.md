# Random Factions Rimworld Mod
Randomly add factions instead of choosing them manually. Every world is unique!

## Why Random Factions?
If you like installing mods that add new factions and xenotypes, you quickly accumulate a large number of factions. Adding them all to each world is tedious, and you don't really need 3 flavors (pirate, rough, & civil) of every single new culture you added to the game.

Wouldn't it be much more fun if each world had a different and unique combination of factions?

Of course that's more fun! And now you can! Just fill your faction list with a dozen random factions and presto!

## Installation and Requirements
This mod depends on the [HugsLib](steam://url/CommunityFilePage/818773962) mod. Please make sure you install that mod first and have it load before this one.

You can install this mod directly from the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2896649114). To manually install, simply download the latest .zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/DrPlantabyte/Random-Factions-Rimworld-Mod/releases) page and extract the **RandomFactions** folder into the *Mods* folder of your Rimworld install (typically located at *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods\*)

## How to use this mod
Random factions adds 4 placeholder factions (see below), each of which is randomly replaced with another faction. Dr. Plantabyte personally recommends 4 random, 2 civil, 2 rough, and 1 pirate factions, plus 1 each of Mechanoid hive and Insect geneline, but you can do any combination you want.

After clicking *Generate*, you will only see the random factions as `?` icons. You won't know who your neighbors will be until the game starts.

Finally, after you start your game, you will be able to see the new factions in the world map.

## Features

### Random Factions

Note: Hidden factions such as Mechanoids Hive, Insect Genelineand the Empire will *not* be randomly selected
* Random Faction: replaced with a randomly selected faction
* Random Civil Faction: replaced with a randomly selected neutral faction
* Random Rough Faction: replaced with a randomly selected aggressive faction
* Random Pirate Faction: replaced with a randomly selected permanently hostile faction

### Random Xenotypes

If you have Biotech DLC installed, then not only do random factions pick a faction when the game starts, but may also substitute the baseliner humans for a randomly selected xenotype.

For example, if you have both [VFE Vikings](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2231295285) and the [Mythic Biotech Expansion](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2883216840) mods installed, then there is a chance that your world may have *Dragon Vikings*!

### Mod Options
You can change the settings for Random Factions in the mod options menu (Options -> Mod Options -> Random Factions)
* Re-organise Factions: if active, then when you create a new colony, the world faction screen wil be pre-populated with a list of random factions instead of all factions
* % Xenotype Fequency: percentage chance of assigning a random xenotype to a randomly chosen baseliner faction (only applies if Biotech DLC is also installed)

## Integration With Other Mods
Any mod that adds a new faction will automatically be detected by Random Factions and will randomly be added to the world when you use the random selection factions described above.

In addition, the following mods unlock extra features when installed alongside Random Factions:

### Faction Control
Random Factions does not interfere with [Faction Control](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2882785581), but changing the faction frequencies in Faction Control will have no affect on the chance of a faction being added by Random Factions.

### Vanilla Factions Expanded - Mechanoids
If [VFE Mechanoids](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2329011599) is also installed, then Random Factions will add another random faction called "random mechanoid", which has a 50-50 chance of turning into either the vanilla Mechanoid Hive faction of the VFE Mechanoid Swarm faction.

### Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids
If [VFE Insectoids](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2149755445) is also installed, then Random Factions will add another random faction called "random insectoid", which has a 50-50 chance of turning into either the vanilla Insect Geneline faction of the VFE Insect Hive faction.

## Fun Things You Can Do With This Mod

And then start a new colony with the following factions or a truly unique game world every time:
* 8 random factions
* random mechanoid
* random insectoid

## Game Saves
Installing Random Factions will have no effect on existing game saves. You will have to create a new game to utilize the random factions mechanics.

In general, uninstalling any mod which adds a faction or xenotype used in your game save can cause data corruption. Random Factions itself can only damage your game save if you have Biotech DLC installed and a xenotype version of a basliner mod was added to your world. In this case, those random xenotype factions will stop working when you load the game without Random Factions.
