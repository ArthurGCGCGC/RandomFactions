# Random Factions Rimworld Mod
Randomly add factions instead of choosing them manually. Every world is unique!

## Why Random Factions?
If you like installing mods that add new factions and xenotypes, you quickly accumulate a large number of factions. Adding them all to each world is tedious, and you don't really need 3 flavors (pirate, rough, & civil) of every single new culture you added to the game.

Wouldn't it be much more fun if each world had a different and unique combination of factions?

Of course that's more fun! And now you can! Just fill your faction list with a dozen random factions and presto!

## Installation and Requirements
This mod depends on the [HugsLib](steam://url/CommunityFilePage/818773962) mod. Please make sure you install that mod first and have it load before this one.

You can install this mod directly from the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2896649114). To manually install, simply download the latest .zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/DrPlantabyte/Random-Factions-Rimworld-Mod/releases) page and extract the **RandomFactions** folder into the *Mods* folder of your Rimworld install (typically located at *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods\*)

## How to use this mod
Random factions adds 4 placeholder factions (see below), each of which is randomly replaced with another faction. Dr. Plantabyte personally recommends 4 random, 2 civil, 2 rough, and 1 pirate factions, plus 1 each of Mechanoid hive and Insect geneline, but you can do any combination you want.

After clicking *Generate*, you will only see the random factions as `?` icons. You won't know who your neighbors will be until the game starts.

Finally, after you start your game, you will be able to see the new factions in the world map.

## Integration With Other Mods

### Faction Control
Random Factions does not interfere with [Faction Control](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2882785581), but changing the faction frequencies in Faction Control will have no affect on the chance of a faction being added by Random Factions.

### Vanilla Factions Expanded - Mechanoids
If [VFE Mechanoids](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2329011599) is also installed, then Random Factions will add another random faction called "random mechanoid", which has a 50-50 chance of turning into either the vanilla Mechanoid Hive faction of the VFE Mechanoid Swarm faction.

### Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids
If [VFE Insectoids](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2149755445) is also installed, then Random Factions will add another random faction called "random insectoid", which has a 50-50 chance of turning into either the vanilla Insect Hive faction of the VFE Insect Geneline faction.
